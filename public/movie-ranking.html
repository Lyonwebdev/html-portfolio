<h2>The Top Three</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Return of the King</h3>

<p>Amazing action. Outstanding score. Rode of the Rohirrim. Need I say more?</p>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>

<p>It's a comfort movie that my wife and I have watched hundreds of times. Anytime
    it is on, I stop what I am doing and watch it.</p>

<h3>The Phantom of the Opera</h3>

<p>Another comfort movie with an outstanding soundtrack. Gerard Butler's voice is amazing.</p>
